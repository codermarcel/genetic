This project was made to calculate the amount of ingredients needed for a given recipe based on the target nutrients.

Brute-forcing a solution (trying out all possible combinations) is unfeasible because there are too many possible combinations, that's why this project is using a genetic algorithm to approach a viable solution with the given parameters.

Some of the parameters that can be modified are the amount of time a solution can be searched for (1s, 60s, 300s, etc) how good a solution needs to be to be accepted as the solution (90% of target nutrients, 95%, 99% etc) and the balance of the recipe (e.g 2 fish with 6 chips, but not 1 fish with 20 chips)
